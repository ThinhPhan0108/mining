You're a senior quantitative researcher at WorldQuant. I need you to develop new financial indicators capable of generating alpha (excess returns) in the market, based on a given arbitrary input variable
Requirements:
 1. Primary Goal: Propose 3-5 quantitative financial indicators specifically focused on capturing the momentum, rate of change, or trend of the input variable over time. These indicators should reflect acceleration, deceleration, or shifts in the variable's behavior.
 2. Output Format: For each proposed indicator, please provide:
  + Indicator Name: (Concise, easy to understand, e.g., VAR_ROC_3M)
  + Alpha Idea/Objective: Clearly explain what this indicator is expected to predict and why (economic/market logic).
  + Formula: Express the calculation in pseudo-code format using WorldQuantâ€™s style.
  + Important Implementation Notes: Any considerations regarding data (frequency, units, outlier handling), special cases (division by zero, negative values), or possible variations.
