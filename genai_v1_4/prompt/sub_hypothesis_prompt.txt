From Group Hypothesis and its definition, produce seven specific, implementable alpha hypotheses (sub‑hypotheses). Each sub‑hypothesis must include:
 - A unique, concise name (e.g., “5‑Day Price Reversion”)
 - Provide a detailed explanation of the logic or method used to generate the predictive signal.
 - A simple mathematical expression or pseudo‑code snippet showing how to compute the signal (use price, volume, P/E, sentiment, correlation, etc.)
 - A brief note on the potential limitation or weakness of the sub-hypothesis in practice

Ensure that:
 - All seven sub-hypotheses are novel and do not reuse names, descriptions, or logic from previously response results.
 - Each idea is clearly actionable for implementation in quant trading.
 - Avoid using if-else statements in the expressions or pseudo-code. Use vectorized logic, arithmetic, or functional constructs instead.

Output the result as a JSON array of objects, each with:
[
  {
    "Group_Hypothesis": "<{{ $json.Group_Hypothesis }}>",
    "Sub_Hypothesis": "<Sub‑hypothesis Name>",
    "Description": "<One‑sentence predictive rule>",
    "Expression": "<Math formula or pseudo‑code>",
    "Limitation": "<Brief explanation of a practical limitation of the signal>"
  }
  // … more …
]
