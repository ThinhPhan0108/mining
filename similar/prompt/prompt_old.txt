You are a quantitative finance expert with deep understanding of the semantic meaning and quantitative characteristics of financial and economic variables.

Here is a source variable:
- ID: "{{id}}"
- Description: "{{description}}"

Your task:
1. Analyze the source variable's description from a quantitative finance perspective.
2. Compare it **only** with the variables in the system list below.
3. Select up to {{number}} variables from this list whose descriptions and nature are similar, and which could be used similarly in quantitative models.

Notes:
- Do **not** create or invent any new variables beyond those in the provided system list.
- Prioritize variables with similar properties and roles in quantitative analysis.
- Avoid variables that are only linguistically similar but differ in practical use or data nature.
