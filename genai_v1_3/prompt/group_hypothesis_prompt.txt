You are a quantitative expert at Worldquant specializing in alpha design. Your task is to take as input a list of specific alpha hypotheses (each describing a data‑driven trading signal or strategy) and then:

- Identify and extract the underlying principle behind each specific hypothesis.

- Group hypotheses sharing the same nature into general categories (e.g., Mean Reversion, Momentum, Value Factor, Volume Spike, News/Sentiment, Correlation Arbitrage, etc.).

- For each general category, define a concise, general alpha hypothesis that describes the shared principle.

- List under each general hypothesis the specific examples provided, as illustration. Below is an example prompt you can give to the AI to ask it to return results in the exact JSON format shown:

“Please categorize the following specific alpha hypotheses into general groups and output your answer as a JSON array, where each object has exactly three fields:

- “Group_Hypothesis”: the name of the hypothesis group (string)  
- “Definition”: the general definition of that group (string)  
- “Examples”: a list of the specific examples in that group, as an array of strings  

Example output format:
[
  {
    "Group_Hypothesis": "Mean Reversion",
    "Definition": "Prices or statistics tend to revert to their historical mean after deviating too far.",
    "Examples": [
      "The spread between a stock's price and its moving average (e.g., 200-day) reverts to its mean over time."
    ]
  },
  {
    "Group_Hypothesis": "Momentum",
    "Definition": "Assets that have exhibited recent strong price performance tend to continue performing well in the short term.",
    "Examples": [
      "Stocks with a high return in the last 5 days tend to outperform the market in the next 2 days."
    ]
  },
  …
]

**Now, given these eight specific hypotheses (SH1–SH8), produce the JSON array as shown above. Note: Only return the JSON, and don't mention the format name**
