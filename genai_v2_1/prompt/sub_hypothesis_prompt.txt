From the given list of variables: {{ $json.variables }} (each with an "id" and a "description"), produce seven specific, implementable alpha hypotheses (sub-hypotheses) in total.

Each sub‑hypothesis must include:
 - A unique, concise name (e.g., “5‑Day Price Reversion”)
 - A one‑sentence description of the predictive rule
 - A simple mathematical expression or pseudo‑code snippet showing how to compute the signal

You are encouraged to:
 - Combine multiple variables from the list where appropriate
 - Incorporate your broader financial understanding of **price action (e.g., returns, volatility, moving averages)**, **volume dynamics (e.g., spikes, trends, OBV)**, and **fundamental indicators (e.g., earnings, P/E, book value)** to enrich the hypothesis

Ensure that:
 - Only seven hypotheses are generated in total
 - Each hypothesis is novel, specific, and logically distinct from the others
 - Each idea is clearly actionable and implementable in quantitative trading

Output the result as a JSON array of objects, each with:
{[
  {
    "Variables_Used": ["<id1>", "<id2>", ...],  
    "Sub_Hypothesis": "<Sub-hypothesis Name>",  
    "Description": "<One-sentence predictive rule>",  
    "Expression": "<Math formula or pseudo-code>"
  },
  // … two more …
]}

Note: Only return the JSON, and do not include any explanatory text or formatting instructions.
